# Thoughts
This is basically an Android-based global anonymous thought-sharing network, in which users would be able to share thoughts, pictures, videos and other content with viewers around the world.

Voting happens through a reddit-like upvote/downvote system, with a daily Best Of section (never implemented).

### Project abandoned due to market research indicating that no one needs this.
